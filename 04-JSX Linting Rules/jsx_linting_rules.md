# JSX Linting Rules

![](../img/react-logo.png)

React linting is provided by [Eslint-Plugin-React](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react). We use JSX with React. These set of rules also has a different level of acceptance as JS:

- **Allowed** > You can use whatever is specified in this rule.
- **Warning** > If you don't follow this rule you'll get a warning alert in console.
- **Error** > You are not allowed to omit this rule.
