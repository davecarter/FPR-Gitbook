# Developer environment Installation
This documentation is a step by step guide to add a development environment to work using JS, SASS and React linting in **Sublime Text 3**. Feel free to use the code editor of your choice. Just make sure you can add *Eslint*, *SASS-Lint* and *Editorconfig* features.

### NodeJS via NVM

We strongly recommend using Node Version Manager to avoid Node versioning hassle.

Open your terminal and type:

````
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.2/install.sh | bash

````

If you need further information visit [NVM GitHub Page](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
