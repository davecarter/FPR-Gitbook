### Comment

Althoug comments are enabled consider using `//` comments over `/* ... */`. The former are more precise single line comments while the later tends to be multiple lines comments rendered in the final css file.

**Bad**

```scss
/* This is a multi line
comment that gets rendered
and tends to be too generic */
```

**Good**

```scss
// This is a one line concise non rendered comment
```
