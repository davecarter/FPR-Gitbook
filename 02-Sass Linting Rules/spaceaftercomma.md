### SpaceAfterComma

Commas in lists should be followed by a space.

**Bad: no space after commas**

```scss
@include box-shadow(0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.2));
color: rgba(0,0,0,.1);
```

**Good: commas followed by a space**

```scss
@include box-shadow(0 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, .2));
color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .1);
```
