### Quotes
**Error** > Enforce **single** Quote Style

This rule is aimed at ensuring consistency of string quotes and as such will report a problem when an inconsistent style is found.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```javascript
var single = "single";     /*error Strings must use single quote.*/
```
