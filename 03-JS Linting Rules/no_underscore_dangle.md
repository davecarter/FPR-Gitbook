### No Underscore Dangle
**Allowed** > Dangling underscores are underscores at either the beginning or end of an identifier, such as:

```javascript
var _foo;
```
Using a single underscore prefix has become popular as a way to indicate "private" members of objects.

Whether or not you choose to allow dangling underscores in identifiers is purely a convention and has no effect on performance, readability, or complexity. It's purely a preference.
