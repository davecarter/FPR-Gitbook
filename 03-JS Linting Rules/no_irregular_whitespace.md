### No Irregular Whitespace
**Error** > Invalid or irregular whitespace causes issues with ECMAScript 5 parsers and also makes code harder to debug in a similar nature to mixed tabs and spaces.

Various whitespace characters can be inputted by programmers by mistake for example from copying or keyboard shortcuts. Pressing Alt + Space on OS X adds in a non breaking space character for example.

Known issues these spaces cause:

- Zero Width Space
-- Is NOT considered a separator for tokens and is often parsed as an Unexpected token ILLEGAL
-- Is NOT shown in modern browsers making code repository software expected to resolve the visualisation
- Line Separator
-- Is NOT a valid character within JSON which would cause parse errors

With this rule enabled the following characters will cause warnings outside of strings:

```
\u000B - Line Tabulation (\v) - <VT>
