### Block Scoped Var
**Allowed** > The `block-scoped-var` rule is intended to generates warnings when variables are used outside of the block in which they were defined. Use `let` and `const` instead if you have setup a JavaScript transpiler like [Babel](babeljs.io) in your development environment.
