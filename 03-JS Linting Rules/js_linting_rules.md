JavaScript is an scripting language based on ECMAScript and created by Brendan Eich.

Currently all modern browsers fully supports ECMAScript 5.1. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and is more commonly referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6.

The following lines are a summary of the JS syntax and rules you must follow in order to be able to commit your changes. Every rule has its own level of acceptance:

- **Allowed** > You can use whatever is specified in this rule.
- **Warning** > If you don't follow this rule you'll get a warning alert in console.
- **Error** > You are not allowed to omit this rule.
