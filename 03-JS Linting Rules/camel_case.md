### Camelcase
**Error** > When it comes to naming variables, styleguides generally fall into one of two camps: `camelcase` (variableName) and `underscores` (variable_name). This rule focuses on using the `camelcase` approach.

```javascript
var my_favorite_color = "#112C85"; /*error*/
```

```javascript
var myFavoriteColor = "#112C85"; /*Good*/
```
