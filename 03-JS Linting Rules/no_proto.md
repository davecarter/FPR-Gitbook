### No Proto
**Error** > `__proto__` property has been deprecated as of ECMAScript 3.1 and shouldn't be used in the code. Use `getPrototypeOf` method instead.

When an object is created `__proto__` is set to the original prototype property of the objectâ€™s constructor function. `getPrototypeOf` is the preferred method of getting *the prototype*.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```javascript
var a = obj.__proto__;    /*error The '__proto__' property is deprecated.*/
var a = obj["__proto__"]; /*error The '__proto__' property is deprecated.*/
```
